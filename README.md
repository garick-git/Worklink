Garick Mendez Padilla - Summer '23 Project

## WorkLink

Worklink is a web application designed to help users manage various tasks and projects efficiently.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create tasks for different projects, and assign your employees to them.
- **User Profiles:** Create user profiles and manage authentication.
- **Contacts:** Share a workspace with co-workers an get access to their contact info on demand.

## Next Steps

Next steps include but are not limited to:
- **Security Implementations:** I am actively working to enhance the security measures of WorkLink. This includes implementing authentication protocols and encryption mechanisms to ensure your data remains safe and confidential.
- **Functionality Expansion:** I want to add new tools such as editing existing tasks, sorting through various tables throughout the site, and expanding on the social aspect of Worklink.
- **Database Connection**: I will replace the db.json file with actual tables using SQL.
- **User Feedback:** User feedback is more than welcome at martin.mendez@erpchile.com
